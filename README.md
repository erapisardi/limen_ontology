This map shows a concept graph (nodes) and relations (edges) of the atoms (chunks) of the knowldge base of Limen (an intelligent interface focusing the DroughtScan Framework). 
Color encodes the relation type (predicate). 
Thickness conveys operational importance (core): low, medium, high. The faible level is a dashed line and marks weak or preliminary links. Read it like this: (1) locate the cluster with the thickest edges; (2) follow the dominant color to see which predicate structures the chain; (3) check for dashed (faible) edges—those are hypotheses or connections to validate. Highly connected nodes are conceptual waypoints: not “truths,” but junctions. This legend is not marketing: it explains how to use the graph to decide where to look next, what to test, and which paths are already robust versus those still under exploration.
